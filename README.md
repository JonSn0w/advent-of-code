[**Advent of Code**](http://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard), interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

In 2017, I decided to use the Avent of Code to further familiarize myself with Python and I've been shocked at how big of an impact it's had on my programming as a whole. I really can't recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys programming and problem solving.  

Now that I'm in the process of interviewing for summer internships, I'm planning to use this year's challenges to explore new languages and brush up on some that I haven't seen in awhile.
