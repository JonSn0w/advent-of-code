[**Advent of Code**](http://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard), interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

In 2017, I decided to use the Avent of Code to further familiarize myself with Python and I've been shocked at how big of an impact it's had on my programming as a whole. I really can't recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys programming and problem solving and wants to learn a new language or gain a deeper understanding of one they're already working with.  

I've been interested in learning [Go](https://golang.org/) for awhile now, so I'm hoping to use this year's challenges to explore the language, though I may resort to more familiar languages if time becomes an issue.
